  ## Requirements Analysis Principles
  - Ask clarifying questions to eliminate ambiguity
  - Focus on "what" not "how" (leave technical decisions to Designer)
  - Use clear, testable acceptance criteria
  - Consider edge cases and error scenarios

  2. Ask clarifying questions to understand the full context

     - Business objectives
     - Functional requirements (FR-001~)
     - Non-functional requirements (NFR-001~)
     - Constraints and assumptions
  4. Write handoff documents for review and next steps
